The Opportunity
We’re looking for a talented Software Engineer with at least 2+ years of professional experience to join our core product engineering team. This is a hands-on, full-stack engineering role where you’ll work directly on high-impact features, shaping the core platform that powers Glade’s AI-driven automation.

As part of a fast-growing company, you’ll be building at startup speed, solving complex technical challenges, and positioning yourself for rapid career growth and leadership opportunities as we scale.


What You’ll Do
Design, build, and ship scalable, high-performance applications in a modern TypeScript/React/Node.js stack.

Collaborate closely with product, design, and fellow engineers to deliver impactful features end-to-end.

Contribute to architecture decisions and help evolve our codebase for speed, reliability, and maintainability.

Write clean, testable code and champion best engineering practices.

Learn quickly, iterate quickly, and have a direct impact on product direction.

What We’re Looking For
2+ years of experience as a software engineer building production-grade web applications.

Strong skills using TypeScript/React/CSS on the frontend, and experience with modern TypeScript/Node.js/PostgreSQL-based backends.

Solid understanding of software design, APIs, and scalable system architecture.

Self-starter who thrives in a fast-paced, high-ownership environment.

Strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset.
